addons.mozilla.org Validator
----------------------------------------

This validator is a proposed replacement for the current addon
validator available at addons.mozilla.org. It is written entirely in
python.

Running
------------

Run the validator as follows:

python package-parser.py <path to xpi> [<expected type>]

The path to the XPI should point to an XPI file.
The expected type should be one of the following values:

-	any : Accepts any extension
-	extensions : Accepts only extensions
-	themes : Accepts only themes
-	dictionaries : Accepts only dictionaries
-	languagepacks : Accepts only language packs
-	search : Accepts only OpenSearch XML files (unpackaged)
-	multi : Accepts only multiextension XPI packages

Specifying an expected type will throw an error if the validator
does not detect that particular type when scanning. All addon type
detection mechanisms are used to make this determination.
